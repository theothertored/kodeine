TODO:
- bundle the extension into one file
- publish repo to github
- add github link to package.json
- create readme for github and the vscode marketplace
- publish to the vcode marketplace as alpha
- check if it really works in the browser
- write instructions on how to install in the browser

MAYBE IN THE FUTURE:
- step by step evaluation

DONE:
- package and install the extension
- design an icon
- implement globals
- make the extension work in browser
- write the formula being evaluated into a treeview
- make sure fl() doesn't print a $ when given an empty string as eval formula
- fix syntax highlighting (again) (turned into a complete grammar overhaul)
- implement fl()
- implement mu(min) and mu(max) (support an array of remaining arguments)
- make evaluation errors return empty string and continue instead of throwing completely
- implement mu()
- implement tc()
- add a \" snippet for inserting tc(utf, 22)
- add a \n snippet for inserting tc(utf, 0a)
- fix syntax highlighting for unquoted string arguments after a quoted string argument
- simple negation -1 => -1.0 behaviour implementation (needs more work)
- fix syntax highlighting for numeric constants
- special highlighting for problematic chars (! ~)
- syntax highlight unquoted strings
- on parse error try to find closing dollar sign, if found, continue parsing instead of completely throwing
- catch evaluation errors in formula, append empty string, report errors via evalCtx
